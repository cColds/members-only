## [Live](https://members-only-m9on.onrender.com/)

## Description
An express app that features a club that members can post messages. Anyone can view messages, but only members in the club can also view the author and date.

## Tools
I used Mongoose's schema, virtuals, and models to write and delete data to MongoDB, PassportJS's local strategy to authenticate, Express Session to store the session, Express Validator to validate fields, bcrypt to compare and hash passwords, and EJS view template.
